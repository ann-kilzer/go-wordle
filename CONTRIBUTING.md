This is a personal project for my own review of golang, so in general, I won't be accepting Pull Requests from outsiders. 
However, if you'd like to extend the project and take it in a creative direction, feel free! It's open source so you can fork as you please! üç¥

This project will also be a demo for Women Who Code Tokyo's Creative Coding Workshop.
