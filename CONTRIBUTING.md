This is a personal project for my own review of golang, so in general, I won't be accepting Pull Requests from outsiders. 
However, if you'd like to extend the project and take it in a creative direction, feel free! It's open source so you can fork as you please! üç¥ And if you make anything cool, please tag me on twitter https://twitter.com/stonecoldkilzer.

This project will also be a demo for [Women Who Code Tokyo's Creative Coding Series](https://github.com/WWCodeTokyo/creative-coding/wiki).
